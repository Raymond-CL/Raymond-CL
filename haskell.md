# How to Haskell

1. install `GHCup` in this [link](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).
2. binares are not installed in the default directory, but the script to add to `PATH` is written in your `.bashrc`, `bash` it.
3. Create source file with extension `.hs`.
4. Compile using `ghc`, with optimize flag `-O*` and silent verbose `-v0`.
5. If you need to use packages, might need to create project using cabal like rust to organize dependencies.
