### :yin_yang: About me :
- 👋 Hi, I’m Raymond
- 🙅‍♂️ In the past, I used to code on a PC which is usually university property. After graduation, I realize that the codes I developed for the past few long hard years will either be copied to some randomly named folder and disappear in my personal hard drive, or permanently destroyed by new students who took over my PC for their own innocent experiment. I have come to understand that it is extremly important to back up all my codes online. Thus I turn to the thing that my computer science colleagues have suggested to me a long time ago, Github. Don't be like me.
- 👀 I am currently a postdoc researcher in high energy nuclear theory, with past experiences in theoretical physics and pure mathematics. My occupation comes with the privilege of dealing with coding on a daily basis. Usually in the language of Fortran, C++, LaTeX, and sometimes Mathematica. So non of those fancy colors and interactive interfaces, just hard core number crunching and algorithmic simulations.
- 🌱 I am not a professional programmer like the rest of the community here on Github. I am just utilizing the program so I can perform numerical analysis on my physics problems. So most of the codes here are going to be ***private***, and the only ***public*** codes will be some of the examples that I am going to share with my students.
- 📫 You can shoot me an email on raymond.chen88@outlook.com, have fun coding.

### 🔐 list of private repositories:

These are some of the private repositories not shown in the list. But you can contact me if you want a clone.

- ***BK-solver***
  - A Fortran program that generates a 2D table of the dipole amplitude $N(r,Y)$ by solving the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation in coordinate (configuration) space, given an intial condition at $N(r,Y=0)$.

- ***RiPQCD***
  - Resummation improved Perturbative QCD is a Fortran program that calculates cross-sections of 2-particle correlations using LO pQCD or Sudakov resummation.
  - processes include: dijet, dihadron, hadron-jet, gamma-jet, gamma-hadron, Z-jet, Z-hadron, Higgs-jet etc. Also include Drell-Yan Z, W, Higgs production.
