**Hello!** I’m Raymond, currently a **Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow** at the *Instituto Galego de Física de Altas Enerxías* (IGFAE), *Universidade de Santiago de Compostela* (USC), Spain.

I work in **high-energy nuclear theory**, with a research focus on:

- Jet quenching phenomenology in heavy-ion collisions.
- Small-*x* physics and gluon saturation.
- Dilepton photo-production in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions.
- Particle multiplicity in QCD jets and related computational methods.

My academic background spans both **theoretical physics** and **pure mathematics**, which allows me to combine rigorous mathematical formalism with large-scale numerical modeling.

In my daily work, I code primarily in **Fortran** and **C++**, typeset with **LaTeX**, and occasionally explore symbolic computation in **Mathematica**.

I also tinker with modern languages for side projects, including **Rust**, **Python** for computation and **Html**, **JavaScript** for web design.

In keeping with my commitment to *open science*, I will endeavour to make publicly available all the code used to produce the results in my publications.

I will also try to update my *personal website* as frequent as possible.

You can find and contact me from the links under my profile picture on the left.
